# Zeal Programming Language.



This branch has working Bytecode virtual machine for Zeal Programming Language. I dont have functions, but it wouldnt take much to implement them again.
Ill eventually merge this into main, but main is kind of a mess right now and undergoing a lot of refactoring for LLVM implementation.
